# Employee Attrition Analysis (SQL + Excel)

This project explores the factors that influence employee attrition using SQL for data analysis and Excel for interactive dashboarding. It demonstrates practical data skills across the lifecycle — from data cleaning and querying to building visuals that communicate insights.

##  Problem Statement

Global X Organization is struggling with employee turnover, which affects productivity and increases hiring/training costs. The goal of this project is to:

- Understand who is leaving, why, and from where.
- Identify patterns that influence attrition (e.g., job roles, departments, salary).
- Provide actionable insights for HR and leadership teams.

##  Dataset Note

The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated using Python for learning and demonstration purposes. It simulates 100 employee records with fields relevant to HR attrition analysis. No real personal or organizational data is used.

## Tools & Skills Used

- **SQL**: Querying data to uncover patterns and summarize attrition metrics
- **Excel**: Building dashboards with pivot tables, charts, and interactivity
- **Data Storytelling**: Turning numbers into actionable narratives for decision-makers

## Key Analyses

### SQL Queries

1. View the first 10 employees
2. Count of employees by department
3. Average salary by job role
4. Total number of employees who left
5. Attrition rate by department
6. Salary comparison between employees who left and those who stayed

### Excel Dashboard

- Interactive slicers by Gender, and Education Level
- Summary cards (total employees, attrition rate, average salary, average performance.)
- Visuals showing results (bar charts, pie charts, column charts)
- Designed for HR teams to quickly identify problem areas

---

## Key Insights

- Operations (31.58%) and IT (32.00%) departments had the highest attrition rates, well above the organizational average of 24%.
- Males (26.79%) were more likely to leave than females (20.45%).
- IT employees received the highest average salary ($129,819.44), followed by Finance ($122,387.13).
- HR had the lowest attrition rate (16.67%) and also one of the lowest average salaries ($110,695.58).
- Employees with higher education levels tend to have higher salaries and lower attrition rates. Master’s degree holders show the lowest attrition (9.5%), while Bachelor’s degree holders have the highest (32.7%). PhD holders earn the most and had no attrition.

##  Conclusion & Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- **Targeted Interventions**: Focus on retaining Bachelor's degree holders—who show the highest attrition—through career development and growth pathways. Additionally, prioritize the Operations and IT departments by addressing workload, team structure, and engagement to reduce overall turnover.
- **Gender-Based Strategy**: Tailor retention plans to address factors causing higher male attrition.
- **Compensation Review**: Ensure salary bands reflect market expectations and job demands, especially in lower-paying roles with high attrition like operations.
- **HR as a Benchmark**: Investigate HR practices to replicate successful retention strategies in other departments.


Proactively addressing these trends can lead to reduced turnover, improved morale, and long-term cost savings.
